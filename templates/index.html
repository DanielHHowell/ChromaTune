        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>The goal of this project is to visualize musical qualities of songs in a playlist in a 3 dimensional space.
            The qualities used here are valence (emotional tone), energy level, and composition (i.e. "acousticness").
            The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_solid">colorsphere</a> is a visual model with 3 dimensions of
            visual information (hue, saturation, and lightness), onto which the musical qualities can be mapped. Specifically,
            valence is represented by hue, energy level by saturation, and composition by lightness.</p>

        <p>It is powered by Python running with Flask, Dash by Plot.ly, and the Spotify API - <a href="https://github.com/DanielHHowell/ChromaTune">Link to GitHub page</a></p>
