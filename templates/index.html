        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>The goal of this project is to visualize musical qualities of songs in a Spotify playlist in a 3 dimensional space.
            The qualities used here are valence (emotional tone), energy level, and composition (i.e. "acousticness").
            The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_solid">colorsphere</a> is a model with 3 dimensions of
            visual information (hue, saturation, and lightness), onto which these musical qualities can be mapped. Here,
            valence is represented by hue, energy level by saturation, and composition by lightness (as in the example below).</p>

        <p>It is powered by Python running with Flask, Dash by Plot.ly, and the Spotify API - <a href="https://github.com/DanielHHowell/ChromaTune">Link to GitHub page</a></p>
